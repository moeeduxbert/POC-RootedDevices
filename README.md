Certainly! Below is a template for a README file for your GitHub repository that focuses on Rooted/Jailbreak device detection:

---



This Proof of Concept (POC) project demonstrates methods to detect rooted Android devices and jailbroken iOS devices. Rooted or jailbroken devices can pose security risks to applications, potentially enabling unauthorized access or tampering. Implementing device integrity checks can enhance the security of your mobile applications.

## Features

- Detect rooted Android devices using various techniques.
- Detect jailbroken iOS devices using different methods.
- Customizable detection thresholds and strategies.
- Easy-to-integrate code snippets for both Android and iOS platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge of mobile application development for Android and iOS platforms.
- Basic understanding of device security concepts.
- Development environment set up for Android and iOS app development.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moeeduxbert/POC_RootedDevices.git
   ```

2. Follow the instructions provided in the respective directories for Android and iOS implementations.

## Usage

- Refer to the provided code snippets and documentation for integrating device detection features into your mobile applications.
- Customize the detection logic based on your application's security requirements and threat model.
